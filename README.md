# Protodash
A quick hack to aggregate a number of Akvo metrics on one page. Static HTML served from Express with Flexbox-layout (to make it responsive-ish) and a few lines of really ugly JavaScript is all that it is for now. Uses some d3.js but otherwise just displays widgets generated by Waffle and Tessera. Also pulls real time operations status from Tessera.

### Plans for the future

Yes. Probably adding a few more sources of data.
